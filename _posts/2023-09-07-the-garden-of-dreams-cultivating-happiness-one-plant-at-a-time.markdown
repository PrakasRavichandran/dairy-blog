### Planting Seeds of Joy: My Garden Journey Begins


As November 30, 2022 dawned, I embarked on an unexpected journey - the journey of creating my own garden. I ventured to a nearby nursery, where a wise old man specially selected five healthy coconut tree plants for me. His experience and care left me with the promise of a lush future garden.

>In every leaf and petal, I discovered the true meaning of happiness

### A Gift That Blooms: The Rose That Stole My Heart

But what truly made that day special was the small rose flower plant the old man gifted me. It was the first time I had ever received a plant as a gift, and the moment was filled with a sense of wonder. In that instant, I realized that love, just like in the movies, often involved flowers. Inspired, I decided to give that rose to someone special.

>With each bloom, it whispered tales of love, both on the silver screen and in my heart

### Veranda of Fragrance: Where Jasmine and Roses Coexist

With the young rose plant cradled in my hands, I made my way home in an auto, eager to begin my gardening adventure. As I reached my house, I carefully placed the rose plant on the veranda, where it basked in the sunlight. Little did I know that this plant would soon become a symbol of joy and friendship in my life.

### Gardening Mischief: Borrowing Joy from Neighbor's Table Roses

My mother, knowing my affinity for gardening, had placed a fragrant jasmine flower plant on the veranda. It filled the air with a sweet scent that both calmed and invigorated the soul. Our veranda was gradually transforming into a green haven.

>Sometimes, the sweetest joys are 'borrowed' from the neighbor's garden

### A Thriving Experiment: How a Pineapple Crown Became a Symbol

In a playful and somewhat mischievous twist, I couldn't resist the allure of table rose flower plants from my neighbor girl's house. With a sly grin and a sense of camaraderie, I "borrowed" a few of them to add to my burgeoning garden. Every day, my mom and I planted new additions - tomatoes, beans, aloe vera, and various colorful flowers. Each plant carried a story and a memory, making our mini-garden a place of constant excitement and discovery.

### Tending to Love: Nurturing My Beloved Rose

One day, I decided to experiment further with my newfound passion. I ate a pineapple, and instead of discarding the top, I decided to plant it. This pineapple crown soon became a thriving pineapple plant, symbolizing my growing fascination with gardening. My mind was fully immersed in the world of plants and possibilities.

>In every leaf I trimmed, I found a piece of myself, growing alongside the rose

As my bond with the rose plant deepened, I took special care to ensure its growth. I researched and prepared meticulously, tending to its needs with love and dedication. It became a representation of my journey - a labor of love that mirrored my own personal growth.

>In the colors and stories of our garden, we found not just plants but the essence of life itself

### From a Rose with Love: Gifting Joy to a Dear Friend

Today, my house boasts a mini-garden filled with life, color, and memories. Every time I step outside to check on my plants, a smile graces my face. My mom watches me, wondering what secret has brought this newfound joy to my life. She might think I'm falling in love with a girl, but the truth is, I've fallen in love with the art of gardening itself.
