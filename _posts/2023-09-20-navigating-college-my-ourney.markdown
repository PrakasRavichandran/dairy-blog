### Introduction
College, they say, is a time for self-discovery and growth. For me, it was all that and more. This is a story of my journey through college, with a particular focus on an unexpected twist in my perspective.

### Shyness and Speaking to Girls
Shyness is a cloak that many of us wear, and I was no exception. Especially when it came to speaking with girls, I was in a league of my own. The mere thought of striking up a conversation would send my heart racing.

### The College Chronicles
My college journey kicked off with the usual freshman jitters. But what really caught my attention was the "night study" sessions that were supposed to be about academics. Instead, they often turned into storytelling sessions.

### Listening to Love Stories
I found myself drawn to tales of love and relationships. It wasn't because I had any experience in that department. In fact, I was a novice in matters of the heart. However, every time someone shared their love story, I listened intently, trying to grasp the essence of it all.

### Love vs. Hormones
As I listened, I couldn't help but notice that many of my peers were treating love as something fleeting. Relationships came and went, and some even ventured into territory typically reserved for married couples. It left me baffled.

### A Gentleman's Perspective
One day, I confided in a classmate about my confusion. I explained how I couldn't understand the casual attitude towards love and relationships around me. Her response surprised me: "You don't have shyness; you're a gentleman." It was a moment of pride for me.

### My Opinion
In the end, my opinion remained unchanged. In this phase of life, I believed that the focus should be on acquiring knowledge and building a future. Love and relationships, while important, should not overshadow the pursuit of education and financial stability.

### Conclusion
College was a transformative period in my life. It not only helped me overcome my shyness but also offered a unique perspective on love and relationships. In a world where casual relationships seemed to prevail, I remained steadfast in my belief that the pursuit of knowledge and financial security should take precedence.
