### A Sweet Beginning

Hey Sweetheart,

How are you doing? I trust life is treating you well. As I pen down this letter, I'm in a good place тАУ both physically and mentally. A stable job, a healthy body, everything seems to be falling into place. But amidst all this contentment, there's an undeniable void тАУ you're not here with me.

I've been waiting for you for a decade now. Yes, you read it right, a decade тАУ ever since I watched the movie "3" (Moonu) in 2013. In that time, I've imagined holding your hand and tightly hugging you countless times. When we finally meet, I must confess, I'll probably cry tears of joy, so please accept that in advance.

I've been busy making preparations for our life together. I've learned to cook, and I've been experimenting with various delicious dishes, all with the intention of pleasing your taste buds. I've even taken up dancing, so we can sway to the rhythm of our love whenever the mood strikes. And when it's time to celebrate anniversaries, we'll share a fine bottle of wine.

### Promises of Care and Understanding

I've familiarized myself with all the little things, the naughty secrets that will bring a smile to your face.I'll sing a songs and playing music for you. During your period, I'll be there to care for you like a guardian, making sure you have dark chocolates and preparing green vegetables without salt and chili, just the way you like. I'll even rub your hips and keep them warm, ensuring your comfort.

You need not worry about your future marriage. I am certain that you will marry a handsome gentleman, and our love story will be our unique bond. We'll have our song, our shared moments, and an unbreakable friendship that will accompany us throughout our days, except, of course, the hours spent in bed.
