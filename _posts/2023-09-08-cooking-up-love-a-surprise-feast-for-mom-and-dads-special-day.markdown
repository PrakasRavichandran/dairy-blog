### A Forgotten Date, A Whirlwind Surprise

On September 11, 2022, I woke up to the realization that it was my mom and dad's wedding anniversary. The date had somehow slipped my mind, and panic set in as I scrambled to make their day special.

My dad's love for masala vada and my mom's adoration for milk vermicelli pudding, a famous Tamil liquid sweet, were the inspiration I needed. I decided to take matters into my own hands and whip up a surprise feast for them.

With a determined spirit, I headed to the kitchen, ready to create a culinary masterpiece. I made a list of all the ingredients required and rushed to the nearby shop to gather milk, vermicelli, cashew nuts, ghee, jaggery, and cardamom, among other things.

First, I began by boiling water and adding jaggery, letting it dissolve to create a sweet syrup. Then, I introduced the ghee-fried vermicelli and sabudana into the mix, creating a delightful concoction that was soon brought to a boil again. After adding milk and cardamom, I allowed it to simmer for 10 minutes until my mom's favorite dish was ready to charm her taste buds.

Next up was my dad's beloved masala vada. Fortunately, I had most of the necessary ingredients on hand. I soaked split Bengal gram dal in water for 30 minutes and set to work on my secret masala recipe. It involved ground pepper, garlic, dry red chili, and salt, and it was a formula known only to me. I ground the soaked dal until it resembled sand and mixed it with the masala. Shaping the mixture into round patties, I prepared to fry them to perfection.

### Milk Vermicelli and Masala Vada: A Feast for the Heart 

I heated a pan on the gas stove, poured in oil, and once it reached the right temperature, I gently introduced the round patties into the sizzling oil. The aroma that filled the kitchen was simply irresistible. In no time, Dad's favorite masala vada was ready, golden and crisp.

With both dishes prepared, I packed them into a traditional brass vessel. Then, with my heart pounding with excitement, I headed downstairs to present the surprise feast to my parents.

### A Surprise Unveiled: Tears of Joy and Laughter

Curious, they asked, "What's all this?" I simply said, "Open it." As they unveiled the contents of the brass vessel, their faces lit up with surprise and delight. Mom and Dad shared smiles and even a few tears of joy. I embraced my mom, and together we wished them a happy anniversary, feeling the warmth of their love.

Not wanting the delicious food to go to waste, I decided to share it with our farm laborers. They were astounded by the culinary delights and showered me with compliments, saying, "Your future wife will be lucky to have such a talented cook." I even gave some extra masala vada to one of the workers, earning a round of applause for my generosity.

Laughter and tears were shared, and it became a cherished memory, reminding us all that sometimes the best surprises are those that come from the heart.
