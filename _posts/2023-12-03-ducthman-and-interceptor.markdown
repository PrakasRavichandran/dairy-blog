## A Love Story on Two Wheels

"Men love their bikes more than their girlfriends," they say. I never understood it until I bought my first bicycle earlier this year. Little did I know that it would kickstart a passionate journey into the world of bikes.

>Sometimes the road less traveled is less traveled for a reason.
*A few months into cycling, I found myself captivated by the thunderous allure of bikes, thanks to the Tamil movie Pollathavan. The on-screen romance between the protagonist and his motorcycle ignited a spark within me.

## More Than Machines, They're Life Companions

>To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist; that is all.

In the end, whether it's the wind in my face on a bicycle or the powerful hum of a motorcycle, these vehicles have become more than machines; they're companions on this incredible journey called life. And, who knows, maybe one day, I'll ride into the sunset on my dream Harley Davidson – the culmination of a passion that started with a simple bicycle.
